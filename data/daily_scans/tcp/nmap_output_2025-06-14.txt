Aggressive OS guesses: Fortinet FortiGate 100D firewall (93%), Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA 8.4) (86%), Adtran NetVanta 1224R or 3430 router (85%), HP ProCurve Secure Router 7102dl (85%), Linksys BEFSR41 EtherFast router (85%), Ricoh Aficio SP C240SF printer (85%)
No exact OS matches for host (test conditions non-ideal).
