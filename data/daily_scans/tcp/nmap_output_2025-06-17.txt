OS fingerprint not ideal because: Host distance (11 network hops) is greater than five
Aggressive OS guesses: Linux 2.6.32 - 3.13 (96%), Linux 2.6.22 - 2.6.36 (95%), Linux 3.10 - 4.11 (95%), Linux 3.10 (94%), Linux 2.6.32 (94%), Linux 3.2 - 4.9 (94%), Linux 2.6.32 - 3.10 (93%), HP P2000 G3 NAS device (93%), Linux 2.6.18 (93%), Linux 3.16 - 4.6 (93%)
No exact OS matches for host (test conditions non-ideal).
