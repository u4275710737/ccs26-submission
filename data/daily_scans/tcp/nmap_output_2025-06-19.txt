Aggressive OS guesses: Cisco 1921 router (IOS 15.1) (89%), Dell PowerConnect 5424 switch (88%), Cisco Aironet 1250 WAP (IOS 12.4) or IOS XE (87%), Cisco 870 router or 2960 switch (IOS 12.2 - 12.4) (87%), OpenBSD 4.0 (x86) (86%), FreeBSD 7.0-RELEASE (86%), Cisco 1841 router (IOS 12.4) (85%), Cisco 836, 890, 1751, 1841, 2800, or 2900 router (IOS 12.4 - 15.1) (85%)
No exact OS matches for host (test conditions non-ideal).
