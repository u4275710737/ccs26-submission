Running (JUST GUESSING): Virdi embedded (86%), Crestron 2-Series (85%), Brother embedded (85%)
OS CPE: cpe:/h:virdi:3000 cpe:/o:crestron:2_series cpe:/h:brother:hl-5250dn cpe:/h:brother:dcp-8065d
OS fingerprint not ideal because: Host distance (11 network hops) is greater than five
Aggressive OS guesses: Virdi 3000 fingerprint access controller (86%), Crestron XPanel control system (85%), Brother HL-5250DN or DCP-8065D printer (85%)
No exact OS matches for host (test conditions non-ideal).
