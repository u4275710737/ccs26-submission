OS fingerprint not ideal because: Host distance (11 network hops) is greater than five
Aggressive OS guesses: Microsoft Windows 8.1 Enterprise (96%), Microsoft Windows Vista Home Premium SP1, Windows 7, or Windows Server 2008 (96%), Microsoft Windows 7 SP1 (94%), Microsoft Windows 8 (94%), Microsoft Windows 10 1511 (93%), Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 (93%), Microsoft Windows Vista Enterprise (93%), Microsoft Windows 7 SP1 or Windows Server 2008 SP2 (92%), Microsoft Windows Windows 7 SP1 (92%), Microsoft Windows Vista SP1 (92%)
